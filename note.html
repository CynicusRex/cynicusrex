    <h2>Pinned</h2>

    <h3><a href="./file/quote.html">Quote!</a></h3>
    <p>Why rewrite what has already been written superiorly. Most of our problems aren't unique and have been solved for ages. Unfortunately, we're bad students.</p>

    <h3><a href="./file/music.html">Favourite music</a>.</h3>
    <p>Music is the language of the soul—humanity at its best. One can only truly know someone by learning their musical taste.</p>

    <!-- <h3><a href="./file/history.html">Read/watch/listen history</a>.</h3>
    <p>To list the things that I've read, seen, or heard from which I've gained insight; starting from 2024. The aim is to reduce endless mindless consumption.</p> -->

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <h3><a href="./file/software.html">Software</a>.</h3>
    <p>A list of mostly excellent free software that I use.</p>

    <h3><a href="./file/unicode.html">Unicode</a>.</h3>
    <p>Shortkeys to my frequently used unicode symbols.</p>

    <h3><a href="./file/codeberg.html">GitHub pages to Codeberg</a>.</h3>
    <p>How to migrate multiple static websites from GitHub pages to Codeberg.</p>

    <h3><a href="./file/zlibrary.html">How to access Z-Library?</a></h3>
    <p>Z-Library is accessible again via https://singlelogin.re. Every user gets their own distinct domain which one should not share.</p>
    
    <h2>Archive</h2>
    <h3><a href="./file/reddit.html">Reddit archive</a>.</h3>
    <p>An archive of (my) reddit comments that are worth something to me; in case I delete my accounts on these increasingly unethical websites.</p>

    <h3><a href="./file/quora.html">Quora archive</a>.</h3>
    <p>I used to be a frequent user of Quora, but deleted my account when it became hard to distinguish genuine from advertised content.</p>
